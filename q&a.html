            Q: Why would one want to keep there infromation safe online?
        </p>
        <p>
            A: The reason why someone would want to keep there information online secure is because
            if someone with malicious intent where to get a hang of that information they could use your credit card
            for example and rack it up with charges. Another example if they where to get a hold of your passwords
            they could hack your accounts or even sell all of your information online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: Why should you not use the same password?
        </p>
        <p>
            A: The reason why you should not use the same password for everything is if someone where to get your email and password
            for one website they could go to the other websites and use the same email and password and login to your other accounts
            and most likely sell that information to the dark web.
        </p>
        <p>
           Q: Why should I change my password after putting my information into a suspicious website? 
        </p>
        <p>
            A: The reason why you should change your password after putting it into a suspicious website is because they can still use that
            password to log into your account but if you where to change your password the user/users won't have access to your account no more.
