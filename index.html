            I choose to research and talk about people's online security and why you should take your online secuirty seriously.
            The reason why I wanted to start researching about this topic is because I seen how my parents and family members where taking
            there online security and thought I should help them to be more secure online while browsing, making new password, etc.
            Another Reason why I choose to do this topic is because in class we where reading a book called the art of invisibility
            and the book was about a former hacker that taught others how to keep there iformation really secure which most people won't do 
            that don't have much experience with technology. Once I really read the book art of invisibility I became inspired to take some of 
            the actions that the author recommended and it has so far helped me and my family stay more safe from identity theft and other sort
            of online security issues.
